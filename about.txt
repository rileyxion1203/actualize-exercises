My name is Riley. I've been immersed in the advertising and marketing sector for Fortune 100 companies in Shanghai for the past three years. During my tenure, I frequently collaborated with product and data teams to optimize advertising algorithms. This experience sparked my interest in coding. I discovered a passion for the creativity involved in coding, finding it more fulfilling than the integrated tasks of marketing and data analytics.

Given my non-traditional background in coding and the current challenging economic climate, I am now aiming to target functional roles within the banking sector or other Fortune 100 companies, such as a position as an engineer at JP Morgan. I'm excited about the opportunity to blend my analytical skills with my newfound coding abilities to contribute meaningfully to a dynamic team.
